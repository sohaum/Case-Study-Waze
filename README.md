# Case-Study-Waze
Waze’s free navigation app makes it easier for drivers around the world to get to where they want to go. Waze’s community of map editors, beta testers, translators, partners, and users helps make each drive better and safer. Waze partners with cities, transportation authorities, broadcasters, businesses, and first responders to help as many people as possible travel more efficiently and safely. 

You’ll collaborate with your Waze teammates to analyze and interpret data, generate valuable insights, and help leadership make informed business decisions. Your team is about to start a new project to help prevent user churn on the Waze app. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. 

This project is part of a larger effort at Waze to increase growth. Typically, high retention rates indicate satisfied users who repeatedly use the Waze app over time. Developing a churn prediction model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business. An accurate model can also help identify specific factors that contribute to churn and answer questions such as: 

## Analysis and Visualization
Your team is still in the early stages of their user churn project. So far, you’ve completed a project proposal and used Python to inspect and organize Waze’s user data.

You check your inbox and notice a new message from Chidi Ga, your team’s Senior Data Analyst. Chidi is pleased with the work you have already completed and requests your assistance with exploratory data analysis (EDA) and further data visualization. Harriet Hadzic, Waze's Director of Data Analysis, will want to review a Python notebook that shows your data exploration and visualization.
